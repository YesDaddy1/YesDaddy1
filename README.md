- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @YesDaddy1 but friends call me Kyle. (side note, the 'YESDaddy1' is an inside joke that makes me giggle)
- ðŸ‘€ I am slowly explanding my knowledge base more and more everyday. IM in school for Cybersecurity, Networking and Cloud Infrastructure. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning EVERYTHING I CAN. I have really been interested in projects that are challenging,  but easy enough that I can do them successfully. I am
just beginning to learn how to code with Python and Html. 
- The thing that I am most proud of up to this point... Hosing a SEIM on an AWS EC2 instance, and connecting a few of my computers as end-devices to monitor. I have a
home lab that consists of VMs and bare computers etc nd I was able to make it all work like you would a small office. It was challenging but really rewarding.

- Short term Goals -CCNA, Sec+, CompTIA CySA+, +/- Networking + debian flavors of Linux, Bash, Python, ZSH and some OS Cybersec Software.
